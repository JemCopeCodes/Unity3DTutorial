Just a heads up this isn't a very "fun/polished" game. Although I learned a LOT from this project it's largely animation and timing--so making it a truly FUN game would take a lot of time that's not worth spending for a learning project. Still, I had fun! Similarly there are problems with optimization that aren't worth chasing down-- so the game has a fair bit of lag. Probably from collisions, especially when the enemies spawn.

There's also some issues with WebGL and playing all the sounds in my version of Unity. So some of the sounds when the admiral are speaking are missing. (A known Unity Bug)

WASD to move, Left Mouse button to shoot.
